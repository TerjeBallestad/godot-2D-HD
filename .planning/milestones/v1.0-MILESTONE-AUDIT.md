# v1 Milestone Audit Report

**Project:** HD-2D Rendering Prototype
**Milestone:** v1 (Evaluation Prototype)
**Audited:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** ✓ PASSED

## Executive Summary

All 12 v1 requirements are satisfied. All 6 phases are complete. Cross-phase integration is excellent (12/12 connections wired). Both E2E flows are complete. The prototype achieves its core purpose: enabling visual evaluation of whether Godot 4 can achieve the HD-2D aesthetic.

## E2E User Flows

### Flow 1: Walk and Look - COMPLETE

| Step | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| User clicks floor | Raycast detects click position | Works via collision_mask=2 | PASS |
| Character moves | Moves toward target | Direct movement with easing | PASS |
| Camera orbit/zoom | Smooth Q/E rotation, wheel zoom | Tween-based with easing | PASS |
| Tilt-shift follows | Blur tracks character focal point | Exponential smoothing | PASS |

**Result:** 4/4 steps pass
**Note:** Pathfinding around furniture deferred; direct movement sufficient for visual evaluation

### Flow 2: Atmosphere Experience - COMPLETE

| Step | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Vignette frames view | Rectangular edge darkening | Warm brown tint at 40% opacity | PASS |
| Volumetric fog | Visible haze around lights | Working at density=0.09 | PASS |
| Bloom on emissive | Soft glow on emitting materials | glow_enabled=true, levels 1,2,4 | PASS |

**Result:** 3/3 steps pass

### Flow 3: Shadow Cast - COMPLETE

| Step | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Point lights shadow | All lamps cast shadows | shadow_enabled=true on 3 lights | PASS |
| Character shadows | Sprite casts via shader | ALPHA_SCISSOR_THRESHOLD | PASS |
| Blob shadow | Decal under character | ShapeCast3D floor detection | PASS |

**Result:** 3/3 steps pass

**Overall:** 2/2 primary flows complete (100%)

### Phase 4: Atmosphere

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Bloom config differs from plan | Info | User-tuned values, visual result approved |

| E2E Flow Completion | 2/2 (100%) | A |
| Tech Debt | 5 items (all Info) | A- |

**Overall:** Excellent - Ready for milestone completion

## Key Findings

### No Blockers

All requirements are satisfied. The prototype is ready for HD-2D visual evaluation.

### Pathfinding Deferred

NavigationAgent3D had oscillation issues and navmesh baking failed to produce usable geometry. Direct click-to-move movement is sufficient for the visual evaluation purpose of this prototype. Pathfinding can be restored if needed for actual gameplay.

### Parameter Tuning

Phase 4 atmosphere parameters were user-tuned during execution. The bloom and volumetric fog settings differ from the original plan specifications but the visual result was approved by the user.

---

## Conclusion

**The HD-2D Rendering Prototype v1 milestone is COMPLETE.**

The prototype achieves its core purpose: enabling the user to walk through an interior scene and visually evaluate whether Godot 4 can achieve the HD-2D aesthetic (Octopath Traveler-like) well enough to warrant switching from Unreal Engine.

### Achieved

- ✓ Interior house scene with 3D furniture
- ✓ Pixel-art sprite character with billboard and shadow
- ✓ Click-to-move navigation with eased motion
- ✓ Camera controls (orbit, zoom, reset)
- ✓ Bloom/glow post-processing
- ✓ Vignette edge darkening
- ✓ Volumetric fog atmosphere
- ✓ Point light character shadows
- ✓ Depth-based tilt-shift with focal tracking
- ✓ Combined miniature/diorama effect

### Ready For

- User visual evaluation and go/no-go decision
- Milestone completion and archival
- (If go) Foundation for full game development
