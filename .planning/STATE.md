## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Depth-based tilt-shift selected over screen-based (more accurate focal plane)
- Interior scene chosen for evaluation (harder lighting case)
- ACES tone mapping with exposure 1.0, white 6.0 for Octopath-style look (01-01)
- Nearest-neighbor texture filtering for crisp pixel art (01-01)
- Perspective camera at 50 FOV for depth effects (01-01)
- **3D furniture models, Sprite3D for characters only** (01-02 user correction)
- **Post-processing (SSAO/glow) disabled** — user preferred clarity over blur (01-02)
